# scuffed-markovbaj

Run ```scuffed-markovbaj.py``` to use. It will play a sentence every 1-2 mminutes. Set the ```MARKOV_START``` and ```MARKOV_END``` enviroment variables to change frequency.

First startup takes a while because the script has to create and compile the model. Subsequent startups are faster.

Requirements: ```pygame```, ```markovify```, ```requests```. Install them using ```pip``` normally.
